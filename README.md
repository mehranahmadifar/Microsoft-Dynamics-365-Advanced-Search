# Microsoft-Dynamics-365-Advanced-Search
Advanced Search Solution for Microsoft Dynamics 365. 

Microsoft Dynamics Search is very consistent and inefficient even if you have added the search fields in Quick Find View.  

With this solution, you can reach the desired record instead of placing an asterisk in the search phrase with space between letters or phrases. 

The entered phrase is also searched in all the fields specified in Quick Find View!

In addition, this solution plugin works for the user and does not prevent the operation of plugins.

Can be installed on Microsoft CRM 2015 and 2016 and Microsoft Dynamics 365.

To import and use the Solution go to Releases tab (https://github.com/mehranahmadifar/Microsoft-Dynamics-365-Advanced-Search/releases)

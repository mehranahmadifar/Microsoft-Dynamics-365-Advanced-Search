Advanced Search Solution for Microsoft Dynamics 365. 

Microsoft Dynamics Search is very consistent and inefficient even if you have added the search fields in Quick Find View.  

With this solution, you can reach the desired record instead of placing an asterisk in the search phrase with space between letters or phrases. 

The entered phrase is also searched in all the fields specified in Quick Find View!
